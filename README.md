#   Fake News Detection using Graph Representation Learning   
Explored some Graph Neural Networks to detect the Fake-News based on the content and the users responsible for its
spread. Used Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks to classify Fake NEWS and got
reliable results, which show that while detecting fake news the Graph network structure play an important role.
